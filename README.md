# 🐢 TurtleTrail

**Turtle Snake** is a cozy twist on the classic Snake game — instead of a snake, you guide a growing line of **cute turtles** across the grid.

Eat tasty leaves 🌿, grow your turtle train, and try not to bonk into walls or your own shell friends.

No installs. No assets. Just open and play.

## 🧠 How It Works (Short)

- The game runs on an invisible grid.
- Each turtle occupies one cell.
- Eating a leaf adds a turtle to the end of the line.
- Speed increases gradually as your score grows.
- The game ends if you hit a wall or your own turtle train.
